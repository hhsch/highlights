My favorite/most interesting projects

1. Polynomial solver in python

2. Compares Euler's method vs. trapezoid method to solve a system,
illustrating ways in which iterative methods can fail/succeed

3. Simulates the famous Lorenz system of equations

4. Solves the physical system described by the heat equation, again
showing how solution methods can do better/worse depending on
the specific situation.

5. Modifies the linux kernel to include a "tag" id on processes,
that can be read/written from runtime. Includes video explanation.
